                        <h1>Traffic Usage</h1>
                        <p>All account plans come with a predetermined amount of traffic quota. We monitor all accounts
                            and services and bill $5.00 USD for each GB of traffic exceeding the predetermined quota.
                            This amount is not prorated, meaning that 1 MB - 1 GB will be treated and billed the same.
                            You may not use more than 50% of your allocated bandwidth for more than 3 hours in a 24-time
                            period.</p>
                        <h1>Network Testing</h1>
                        <p>Any kind of network stress testing is strictly prohibited. If you are found to be a source of
                            any cyber-attack or unsolicited stress testing your account will be closed and your services
                            to be immediately canceled.</p>
                        <h1>Server abuse</h1>
                        <p>Any attempt to undermine or cause harm to a server or customer of HostPul is strictly
                            prohibited. As our customer, you are responsible for all your accounts. Should you violate
                            the Terms of Services outlined within, your account will be canceled without the chance of
                            refund.</p>
                        <h1>Your account</h1>
                        <p>If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
                            and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept
                            responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You may not
                            assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity. You acknowledge
                            that HostPul is not responsible for third party access to your account that results from
                            theft or misappropriation of your account. HostPul and its associates reserve the right to
                            refuse or cancel service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content in our sole
                            discretion.</p>
                        <h1>Refusal of Service</h1>
                        <p>We reserve the right to refuse, cancel, or suspend service, at our sole discretion.
                            <br><br>
                            All sub-networks, distributive hosting sites and dedicated servers of HostPul must adhere to
                            the above policies, except system resources in respect to dedicated servers.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Billing</h1>
                        <p>By the Account Activation Date of each month, HostPul shall either:
                            <br><br>
                            (1) debit the client's credit card (when such information has been provided by the client);
                            or
                            <br><br>
                            (2) deliver, by e-mail or regular mail, an invoice following the applicable Service Fees for
                            services rendered for the current month. When an invoice is delivered to the client, payment
                            shall be remitted to HostPul by no later than the specified payment due date. HostPul shall
                            be entitled to immediately terminate this agreement for client's failure to make timely
                            payments. You will be provided with an invoice every month. All credit cards are billed
                            automatically per the selected billing cycle. It is the client's responsibility to ensure
                            that they have sufficient credit to cover this transaction. If there is insufficient credit,
                            we will send an e-mail notification, at which point we will need to be provided with another
                            credit card account number within 24 hours. If we do not receive a response within 24 hours,
                            the account, and all accounts under that account plan, will be suspended.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Chargebacks, disputes, and claims</h1>
                        <p>Any chargeback, dispute, or claim filed against us will result in an immediate termination of
                            all products and or services linked to the client's account. To reactivate terminated
                            services, the client must reimburse HostPul for the full value of the chargeback, dispute,
                            or claim. Any associated fees HostPul incurred due to such cases must be paid in full by the
                            client as well as a $10.00 USD administrative fee.</p>
                        <h1>Termination/Access Restriction</h1>
                        <p>HostPul reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site and
                            the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum
                            extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas and
                            you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Texas in all
                            disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized
                            in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including,
                            without limitation, this section.
                            <br><br>
                            You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
                            between you and HostPul as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. HostPul's
                            performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing
                            contained in this agreement is in derogation of HostPul's right to comply with governmental,
                            court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or
                            information provided to or gathered by HostPul with respect to such use. If any part of this
                            agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including,
                            but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then
                            the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable
                            provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder
                            of the agreement shall continue in effect.
                            <br><br>
                            Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
