                            service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use

                        <h1>Use of Cookies</h1>
                        <p>The HostPul website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A
                            cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot
                            be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned
                            to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
                            The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.
                            For example, if you personalize HostPul pages, or register with HostPul site or services, a
                            cookie helps HostPul to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This
                            simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
                            shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same HostPul website, the information
                            you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the HostPul features that
                            you customized. </p>
                        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
                            cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
                            If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
                            features of the HostPul services or websites you visit. </p>
